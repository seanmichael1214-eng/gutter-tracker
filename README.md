# Gutter-Tracker (Project SmartGutter)

**Status:** *Prototype / Proof of Concept*

## 📝 Overview
In the seamless gutter installation industry, "run-out" (material waste due to incorrect measurements) is a significant cost. **Gutter-Tracker** is a Python-based logic system designed to interface with a Raspberry Pi and a rotary encoder wheel attached to an industrial gutter machine.

## 🎯 The Goal
To replace manual tape-measure verification with an automated digital readout, ensuring:
1.  **Precision:** +/- 0.5 inch accuracy over 100ft runs.
2.  **Safety:** Reducing the need for operators to physically interact with the machine output during operation.
3.  **Data:** Logging daily material usage for inventory tracking.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)
*   **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero W, Rotary Encoder (Optical).
*   **Software:** Python 3.
*   **Logic:** Pulse counting converted to linear feet based on wheel circumference.

## 💡 Why This Matters
This project represents the intersection of **Industrial Operations** and **IT Automation**. It solves a physical, "blue-collar" problem using code.
