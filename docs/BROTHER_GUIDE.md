3. **Snap a Photo** of the house from the driveway
   - Tap "Open Camera" 
   - Take a pic of the roofline
   - Tap "Get AI Estimate"

4. **AI Analyzes** the house and estimates:
   - Linear feet of gutter needed
   - Number of downspouts
   - Corners, elbows, end caps

5. **Instant Price Quote** with your markup built in!

6. **Copy & Send** to customer right there

## ⚙️ SET UP YOUR PROFILES

### Why Two Profiles?

**Flo-Rite (Work)**
- Company pricing
- Company labor rates
- Standard markup

**Triple Beezy (Side Jobs)**
- YOUR material costs
- YOUR labor rate
- YOUR markup (can be higher!)
- Keep it separate from work

### Set Your Workflow Preferences

Tap **"🔧 My Workflow Preferences"** to tell the AI how YOU work:

| Setting | What It Means | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Hangers Per Foot | How often you put hangers | 0.5 = every 2 feet |
| Elbows Per Downspout | A + B elbows total | Usually 2 |
| Downspout Per Story | Length per story | 10 ft |
| Splash Block Per DS | Do you include them? | 1 = yes |

### Set Your Pricing

Tap **"💰 Pricing Settings"** to enter YOUR costs:

- Gutter coil ($ per foot)
- Downspouts ($ per section)
- All the fittings (corners, elbows, etc.)
- Labor rate ($ per foot)
- **Markup %** - Your profit margin!

**Tip for Triple Beezy:** Set a higher markup (40-50%) since you're keeping all the profit!

Tap **"Save Settings"** - they'll remember for next time.
