# Gutter Tracker - Your Personal Job & Inventory Management App

## Product Overview

**Gutter Tracker** is a complete web-based business management system designed specifically for gutter installation professionals. Built with cutting-edge AI technology and modern web standards, this app helps you track customers, manage jobs, monitor inventory, and generate estimates—all from your phone, tablet, or computer.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Multi-User Inventory Management**
Keep separate inventory for different crews, locations, or business partners. Each user gets their own color-coded workspace with instant switching between profiles. No more mixing up materials or losing track of who has what.

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Estimating**
Take a photo of a house and let Google's Gemini AI instantly estimate linear feet of gutters, number of downspouts, corners, and elbows needed. Get professional estimates without climbing a ladder. The AI analyzes roof lines, stories, and complexity to give you accurate material counts every time.

### 💬 **Chat-Based Inventory Control**
Manage your inventory by simply typing commands like "add 50 feet of K-style gutter" or "update item 3 quantity to 20". No complicated forms—just natural language commands that get the job done fast.

### 📊 **Complete Job Tracking**
Schedule jobs, track status (scheduled → in-progress → completed), manage customer information, and monitor revenue—all in one place. See your completed jobs, scheduled work, and total earnings at a glance on the dashboard.

### 📸 **Photo Documentation with AI Analysis**
Snap photos of job sites and let AI analyze gutter condition, identify damage, estimate repair urgency, and recommend solutions. Every photo gets stored with the job for your records.

### 📦 **Smart Inventory Scanner**
Point your camera at materials and the AI will identify items, estimate quantities, and suggest pricing. Perfect for quick stocktakes or receiving deliveries.

### 🎨 **Mobile-First Design**
Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Responsive interface adapts to your screen size. Access your business from the job site, the truck, or the office.

### 🔐 **Secure & Private**
Password-protected with session-based security. Your business data stays private and isolated per user. Built-in audit trails track all inventory changes for accountability.
